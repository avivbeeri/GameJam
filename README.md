A game for the gamejam!

People working on this: Aviv, Sanchit, Medbh  
As of yet we haven't assigned any kind of roles.

Summary:  
Cyberpunk heroes break into a building for fun, profit and adventure! Entirely within 64*64 pixels!

Plot:  
The player character is a mercenary who procures information for people from others.
So she breaks in, steals stuff and tries to leave no trace.   
They call her "The Ghost", because no one sees her, thanks to careful use of thermoptic camouflage.  
So the game is not getting caught by guards or cameras, using an invisibility power that has limited charges, and a short time limit.  


Design philosophy:  
DRY, KISS, others?
